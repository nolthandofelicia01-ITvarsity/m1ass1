        <p>New York City, often called The City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. It is a big city known for its skyline, various districts such as fashion, diamond, Broadway, stock market, tons of stores to shop, endless selection of resturants, bars and coffee shops. Not to mention the diversity of the food. Museums, art etc. Most of its accessible without a car. Right outside the city you have excellent beaches, forests, parks etc. Ski, swim, boat, catch a show, shop eat. The culture, traditions and natural beauty of New York make it a great state.New York is full of things to do. You could literally spend a lifetime in this city and do something different each day. With so much to see, it can be overwhelming trying to plan a trip to this beast of a city but i can guarantee you that you wont regret your decision. There are places you can go visit like the Empire State Building, New York is home to more than 80 musuems, and there is no way you can see them all. From edgy picks like the Musuem of Sex, to classics like the American Musuem of History, there is a little something for everyone. Most people visit the Statue of Liberty, its like going to Paris without glimpsing the Eiffel Tower. Its just something you got to do!</p>
